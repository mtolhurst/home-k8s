# Baikal

A simple, multi-user caldav server.

Unfortunately it does not support shared calendars (well, not easily. It is theoretically possible with a plugin and manual db tweaks)

To get around this, in order to share calendars, I'm just creating a shared account, and giving the creds to all users.
